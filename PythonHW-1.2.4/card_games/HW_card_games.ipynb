    "## Problem 1: Card\n",
    "\n",
    "To play card games, we'll first need some cards! Let's define a `Card` class that we'll be able to store in a `Deck`\n",
    "object later on. To get comfortable with writing classes, we'll start out with a skeleton. Later on you'll build your\n",
    "own `Deck` class from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's decide on the set of features we want out of our `Card` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rank Each `Card` should keep track of its `rank`. These are the ranks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen,\n",
    "King, and Ace. We can easily store this as an integer from 2 to 14. We should be able to access this by calling `.rank`\n",
    "on a `Card`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> Card(3, \"C\").rank\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Suit\n",
    "Each one of our `Card`s will be one of four suits: Clubs, Hearts, Spades, or Diamonds. Let's store this in a string.\n",
    "We should be able to access this by calling `.suit` on a `Card`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> Card(4, \"D\").suit\n",
    "'D'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### repr\n",
    "We should override the `__repr__` function of our `Card` class so that it will print nicely. We'll write this\n",
    "to print out \"[rank] of [suit]\" where [rank] is the rank of our card and [suit] is its suit. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> Card(7, 'H')\n",
    "7 of Hearts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparison functions\n",
    "For some games, we may wish to compare the ranks of two `Card`s against each other. The final functions we'll write for our `Card` class are the comparators `<, <=, ==, >=, >`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> Card(2, 'H') < Card(10, 'S')\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> Card(4, 'C') == Card(4, 'D')\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> Card(8, 'D') >= Card(14, 'D')\n",
    "False\n",

    "`False` by default. It can simply be initialized as `my_deck = Deck()` or you can explicitly pass in whether to shuffle\n",
    "the deck: `my_shuffled_deck = Deck(True)`. This initialization function should create a member variable `cards` that\n",

    "Additionally, the initialization function should keep track of the number of cards that have been dealt. This will be\n",

    "A `Deck` object should be able to deal `Card`s off the top. We'll write a function `deal_card` that\n",

    "Deck(dealt 52, shuffled=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### repr\n",
    "We'll write our own `__repr__` function for the `Deck` class just as we did with `Card`. The repr in this\n",
    "class will simply print out that it is a `Deck` object, the number of cards that have been dealt, and whether the deck\n",
    "has been shuffled:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> my_deck = Deck()\n",
