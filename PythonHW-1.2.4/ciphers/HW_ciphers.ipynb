    "# Fun with Ciphers\n",

    "## Caesar Cipher\n",
    "A Caesar cipher is a cryptographic function that takes as input a plaintext string and outputs a ciphertext string that is the encoding of the input. Specifically, the Caesar cipher shifts each letter of the alphabet by some fixed amount, wrapping at the end of the alphabet and ignoring whitespace. For example, the string\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CogWorks is fun\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "encoded using a Caesar cipher with shift 3 becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FrjZrunv lv ixq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down how this works. We'll order the alphabet so that lowercase letters come before capital letters. This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher will shift each letter by some amount. In our case, we chose to shift by 3 characters. This means we'll map `a` to `d`, `b` to `e`, ..., `w` to `z`, `x` to `A`, ... `W` to `Z`, `X` to `a`, `Y` to `b`, and `Z` to `c`. We can create a mapping just like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially what the Caesar cipher is doing. Now if we want to encode our string, we see that `C` maps to `F`, `o` maps to `r`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversing the process to decode a string is quite straightforward. If we receive the encrypted string\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wlys yvjrz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and we know that it was encoded using a Caesar cipher with shift 7, we can easily create our reverse substitution alphabet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefg\n",
    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and decode the message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Perl rocks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact: The ROT13 algorithm is a famous special case of the Caesar cipher. It assumes all letters are the same case. What's special about ROT13 is that it is its own inverse: you apply the exact same function to both encode and decode your string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breaking the Caesar Cipher\n",
    "While not very secure, the Caesar cipher can be effective as a very weak form of encryption. Note that to break the encryption, we can simply try shift amounts from 1 through 25 and see which one comes out as correct English. This is a *brute-force* solution."

    "\n",
    "With the keyword cipher, there are `403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000` permutations of the alphabet. And this is with only lowercase letters! Even if we could check 2 billion permutations each second, it would take more than 6 billion years to try all the possible permutations here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, this is where things like frequency analysis come into play, where if we have enough encoded text we can look at the frequency of each letter and try to match these to known frequencies of English. For example, the letter 'e' is very common and if the frequency of 'q' in the encoded text is close to that known frequency, then 'q' probably maps to 'e'. Of course, there are many sophisticated techniques in cryptanalysis worth exploring."
