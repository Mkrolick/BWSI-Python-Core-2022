    "In mathematics, a function $f(x)$ is said to have a \"fixed-point\" solution if there exists a value $x_{*}$ such that $f(x_{*}) = x_{*}$. That is, $f$ maps $x_{*}$ to itself. As a simple example, given $f(x) = x^{2}$, check that $f$ has a fixed-points at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a less trivial example, let's see if the function $f(x) = x^{2} - 1$ has any fixed points. That is, we want to find all solutions to $f(x) = x$:\n",

    "### Caveats to the relaxation method \n",
    "For all its simplicity, the relaxation method is not a completely robust solution for finding fixed points, in which case this method can only potentially find one, for a given initial guess. It will fail if your function does not have fixed points. It is also very much possible for a function to have multiple fixed points. Additionally, this iterative process can \"blow up\" and lead you to ever-growing numbers if you use a \"bad\" starting guess. It is possible for the relaxation method to get stuck in a loop. If you try to find the fixed points for $x^2 - 1$ using an initial guess of $x_{o} = 0.5$, you will find that you eventually repeatedly guess 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, .... Be aware of these pitfalls when you are testing your code - they are a fundamental issue of the relaxation method, and not a symptom of bad code. \n",

    "You have likely held a bar-magnet before - a special kind of metal that can use its magnetic field to push or pull on other magnets. Such a material is known as a ferromagnet, and it's magnetic properties are created by coordinated behavior among the electrons belonging to its atoms. The electrons in a ferromagnet naturally coordinate in such a way to create an overall magnetic field throughout and around the material. However, heating up a ferromagnet will jostle its atoms and electrons around, disturbing the coordination of the electrons and thus weakening the net magnetic field of the material. If you set out to describe the statistical behavior of a ferromagnetic material's electrons, you will eventually find that the strength of its magnetization, $M$, depends on temperature, $T$, according to the following equation:\n",
