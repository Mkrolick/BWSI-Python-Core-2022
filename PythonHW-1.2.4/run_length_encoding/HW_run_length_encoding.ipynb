    "# Run-Length Encoding\n",
    "Run-length encoding is a simple method for compressing data that contains long sequences of repeated characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this compression algorithm:\n",
    "1. A standalone character will be unchanged. E.g `\"a\"` $\\rightarrow$ `[\"a\"]`. \n",
    "2. A run of a character, `c`, repeated `N` times will be compressed to `[\"c\", \"c\", N]`. E.g. `\"bbbb\"` $\\rightarrow$ `['b', 'b', 4]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two rules are all that you need to perform run-length encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a few examples of run-length-encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"abcd\"` $\\rightarrow$ `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`\n",
    "- `\"abbbba\"` $\\rightarrow$ `['a', 'b', 'b', 4, 'a']`\n",
    "- `\"aaaabbcccd\"` $\\rightarrow$ `['a', 'a', 4, 'b', 'b', 2, 'c', 'c', 3, 'd']`\n",
    "- `\"\"` $\\rightarrow$ `[]`\n",
    "- `\"1\"` $\\rightarrow$ `[\"1\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The decompression algorithm, run-length decoding, simply reverses this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `['q', 'a', 'a', 4, 'b', 'b', 2, 'c', 'c', 3, 'd']` $\\rightarrow$ `'qaaaabbcccd'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you will implement a run-length encoding and decoding algorithms. As indicated above, the run-length encoding algorithm should be able to accept a string and return a list with the appropriate string/integer entries, according to the encoding. The decoding algorithm need be able to accept a list with an encoded sequence, and return the decoded string.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to test both of your algorithms by feeding them into one another:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> decoder(encoder(\"Wooooow!!!!! I'm totally getting compressed\"))\n",
    "\"Wooooow!!!!! I'm totally getting compressed\"\n",
    "```"
